# muicss-yew

[MUI-CSS](https://github.com/muicss/mui) Components for [Yew framework](https://github.com/yewstack/yew).

:construction: WIP

I'm not familiar with frontend development, and does not have a lot of time to maintain this library. But using MUI-CSS directory (i.e., with CSS and JS) with Yew as also very easy.

For other Yew component libraries, please see[awesome-yew](https://github.com/jetli/awesome-yew#component-libraries).
